# Caesar-Cipher
In this project I need to implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string

- I think, I'll need to create a range A..Z to iterate over it.
- Maybe I also have to transform a string in array of characters.
- Create a method caesar_cipher with two parameters and nested inside this method another small methods for better readability
